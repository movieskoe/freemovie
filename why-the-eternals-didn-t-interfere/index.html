<section><h2>As Plain As The Answer Might Seem, The Eternals Didn’t Lend A Hand To The Avengers In Avengers:</h2><br/><p>And exactly why he would do that? Their record looks even worse considering thanos (in the comics, at least) is an eternal himself, of a fashion. The eternals specifically state that they did not interfere with thanos and his genocidal finger snap due to their sacred mission, which only allowed intervention when the deviants were involved.</p><h2>That Could Be Why The Eternals Did Nothing When Thanos Attacked.</h2><br/><p>That means that, bizarre as it might seem, intervening in thanos. Director chloé zhao explains that the reason why the eternals didn't interfere in the mcu before was so that heroes like the avengers can be made. One is, the eternals were broken!</p><h2>The Clip Addresses Why The Eternals Didn’t Save The Earth From Thanos When Gemma Chan (As Sersi) Explains That They Had Been Instructed To Not Get Involved Unless The Deviants Were Involved.</h2><br/><p>The truth is they were instructed not to interfere by the celestials, the beings who created the eternals. The eternals were likely aware of the danger, but didn&#039;t want to risk angering either their own leader (salma hayek&#039;s ajak) or the celestials. The eternals didn’t interfere in the mcu because of the avengers.</p><h2>The Eternals, Tasked With Keeping An Eye On The Humans, Intervene Only When Deviants,.</h2><br/><p>The truth is they were instructed not to interfere by the celestials, the beings who created the eternals. The simpler answer is found in the neil gaiman eternals series, where most of the eternals have no idea that they are actually eternals. They’re living their lives as if they are humans initially.</p><h2>And That Was The Instruction From The Prime Celestial.</h2><br/><p>The article details that the eternals mission is to focus on their nemeses the deviants and to never interfere in human affairs. Infinity war, seemingly chose not to chase down thanos during the intervening years, and then went missing once again during the fateful avengers: Our mission is to deliver content that helps you embrace marvel, dc comics, star wars &amp;.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="Trailer out for Eternals!
