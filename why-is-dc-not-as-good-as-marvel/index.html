On the other hand, dc comics has started in 1935 in california, who later became a subsidiary of warner bro. Zack snyder explains why dc movies can&#039;t be like marvel movies.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="Why Gambit And Rogue Would Never Have Worked" rel="nofollow" title="Why Gambit And Rogue Would Never Have Worked" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Image-80-600x684.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: bing.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>Why Gambit And Rogue Would Never Have Worked</i></a>, They’re humans who have to rise as gods, and this means they also have human problems which are more prevalent throughout their stories than ‘godly’ ones i.e. Both marvel and dc have their own merits and flaws, with the former having pioneered the concept of flawed heroes existing in a.</p></aside><h3>Why Gambit And Rogue Would Never Have Worked</h3><p>They’re humans who have to rise as gods, and this means they also have human problems which are more prevalent throughout their stories than ‘godly’ ones i.e. 10 minutes in a movie isn't enough time to get hyped and care about a superhero.
