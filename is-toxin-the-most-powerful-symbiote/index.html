<section><h2>As Toxin Grew Stronger, Venom And Carnage Planned To Destroy It Together, Yet Mulligan Hoped To Use.</h2><br/><p>The toxin symbiote spawned from carnage, who had hoped to kill its offspring (a venom family lineage that now spanned a thousand others symbiotes). Toxin was the most powerful symbiote on the planet earth when he first appeared, the 1,000th spawn of carnage. As the symbiotes have evolved on earth, there is one that is more powerful than the rest.</p><h2>His Powers Were Quite Similar To Carnage And Venom, But He Was More Powerful Than Both.</h2><br/><p>While venom's elevation to the king in black has turned him into a veritable symbiote god, toxin is still the most powerful naturally occurring symbiote on earth from a genetic standpoint, even compared to the other symbiotes of his family. It bonded with police officer pat mulligan and learned much about the world and how to become a true hero. The first host of the toxin symbiote is former nypd cop patrick mulligan.</p><h2>The Raw Power Of Toxin Was So Great That He Was Feared Even By The King In Black, Knull, Creator And Leader.</h2><br/><p>Toxin was fast becoming more powerful than either venom or carnage, leading to them teaming up against it. The son of carnage, toxin, was believed to be the most powerful symbiote ever created. Toxin was the most powerful symbiote on the planet earth when he first appeared, the 1,000th spawn of carnage.</p><h2>Toxin Was Born From Carnage, The 1000Th Spawn From Its Lineage, And Was Actively Feared By Both Venom And Even Carnage Itself As Having.</h2><br/><p>Toxin was born from carnage as the 1000th symbiote in that lineage, giving him spectacular powers and strength. Toxin (translated in spain as toxina), or the toxin symbiote is a fictional antihero and sometimes supervillain in the marvel comics universe. Gargan became a host to the venom symbiote after eddie brock passed away from cancer and rejected don fortunato’s son angelo.</p><h2>The Toxin Symbiote Is Another Spawn Of The Carnage Symbiote That Has Moved Through A Few Hosts Over The Years, Though When Toxin Joined The Savage Six, It Was After The Symbiote Was Forcibly Bonded To Eddie Brock, Former Host Of The Venom Symbiote.</h2><br/><p>Toxin bonded with nypd officer patrick mulligan, but since the symbiote was still young, it didn’t affect him much. He even did it with venom: This scared venom and carnage, who both realized that toxin would soon dwarf their combined powers.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="10 Most Powerful Symbiotes" rel="nofollow" title="10 Most Powerful Symbiotes" src="https://i2.wp.com/geeky-nerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Venom-10-Most-Powerful-Symbiotes.png" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: google.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>10 Most Powerful Symbiotes</i></a>, However, he’s not just a regular symbiote.

The toxin symbiote spawned from carnage, who had hoped to kill its offspring (a venom family lineage that now spanned a thousand others symbiotes). It bonded with a local officer and had many conversations about life and how to conduct itself in the real world. However, he’s not just a regular symbiote.

Toxin proved to be so much more powerful than both carnage and venom that the two wanted to take him out together, but spidey, who saw the good beneath the power, helped mulligan use his symbiote to fight more nefarious versions of his own kind.
