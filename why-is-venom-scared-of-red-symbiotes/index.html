Why is venom scared of red one? Brock wants to be a good person, while the symbiote proclaims he&#039;s a predator who wants to be out there snacking on bad guys. carnage, on the other hand, wants venom to let loose and join him.</p><h2>The Question Seems Vague If We Look At The History Of Symbiotes.</h2><br/><p>Venom tells the origin story of journalist eddie brock, who during an investigation of the experiments at life foundation, ends up bonding with an alien symbiote, as the lab was experimenting on humans and symbiotic life forms. We all know that there will be carnage as the phrase is in the title of the movie. While fans saw in the trailer that kasady had tuned it o a powerful red monster and it was the first instance that indicates that the vicious serial killer is a red symbiote.</p><h2>It&#039;s Possible Red Denotes Mental State A Symbiote Born Psychotic Is Red, In The Comics Carnage Isn&#039;t Venoms First Offspring I Think He&#039;s Something Like The 1000Th, With Venom Stating The More Offspring A Symbiote Has The Greater The Chance Of Them Being Born Insane, Venom Eats People To Sustain Itself But Usually The Adrenaline Produced By The Host Is Enough To Keep It Fed,.</h2><br/><p>We saw that in the first movie that riot was their leader and had qualities that enabled him to lead. Why does carnage hate venom? But, one thing was obvious, that venom was scared of carnage.</p><h2>The Movie Doesn’t Clearly State Why, But Venom Is Probably Afraid Of Carnage Because Carnage Doesn’t Have The Moral Restrictions That Venom Does.</h2><br/><p>Brock is able to convince venom to continue the fight, though there isn&#039;t much explanation given to movie fans about why venom was scared of a red symbiote. The reason for him turning into a red symbiote takes us back to an even bigger question of what caused the monster to be created in the first place.
