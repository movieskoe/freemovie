<section><h2>Let There Be Carnage Will Unleash The Psychotic Terror Of Carnage.</h2><br/><p>For almost the entirety of carnage’s existence he’s had two weaknesses that all symbiotes share: That blood turns into a red symbiote similar to venom—a sort of child—only it’s much, much more powerful. I saw many comments saying venom is absolutely outclassed, riot is more powerful than even carnage, and stuff like that, which we’ll get to later.</p><h2>His Power Came Through His Independence From Venom;.</h2><br/><p>Even worse, cletus kasady already seems more powerful than eddie. If we're talking about who's stronger between carnage and “venom as in. Carnage is a ruthless version of venom without moral inhibitions and although he might not be much more powerful than venom, he is certainly more dangerous.</p><h2>While Captain America Is A Formidable Foe And A Skilled Fighter, Carnage Would Be Able To Defeat Him, If Not Slaughter Him Completely.</h2><br/><p>Venom did tried to catch up over the years, but overall carnage was portrayed for many years as the stronger and most savage of the two. Only eddie and venom can stop kasady and carnage. At their base level, carnage was strongest out of the two.</p><h2>The Venom Vs Carnage Fight, Also Here, Has Been On Yt For A Few Weeks.</h2><br/><p>Venom almost died himself fighting riot, meaning that riot was stronger and more agile, throwing objects/projectiles at venom and even making a sickle out of a hand. Carnage is more powerful or at least he was before he was ripped in half in space by the sentry.but i&#039;m sure that carnage and eddie brock venom are both more powerful than mac gargan. nope. (and therefore, much, much more bloodthirsty.) kasady escapes prison with his new parasitic friend, named carnage.</p><h2>With The Power To Grow Exponentially Stronger By Feeding Off Negative Energy, He&#039;s Stronger Than Venom With None Of The Weaknesses.</h2><br/><p>Because of the way symbiote genetics work, toxin is still stronger than venom&#039;s new children, like sleeper. Venom is currently stronger cause he bonded with more hosts than carnage.
