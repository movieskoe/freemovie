<section><h2>Riot Can Transform At An Extremely Fast Speed And Can Defeat Venom, Being Able To Morph Its Hands Into Large Blades And Other Forms Of Weapons Capable Of Mass Destruction.</h2><br/><p>Venom is pretty much the standard symbiote, the one that most of us know best. I give riot the advantage in combat speed. As the maniacal carnage, kasady has been killed multiple times over the years, but he always finds a way to come back, stronger than ever.</p><h2>This Version Of Riot Symbiote Is Far More Powerful Than Its Original Comic Incarnation.</h2><br/><p>In terms of brute strength, yes, carnage is stronger than venom. Hulk (2008) vs riot (venom 2018) we know hulk is much stronger than riot, but we don't really know the upper limits of riot's crazy regen/durability. Riot’s strength was greater than venom’s;</p><h2>As Proven When He Easily Overpowered Him, Since He Had A Greater Manifestation.</h2><br/><p>Carnage was the spawn of venom, and that made him stronger than his father. Why is riot stronger than venom? He is faster and stronger than venom and was, at one time, the strongest symbiote in existence.</p><h2>In Addition, Riot Is The Main Villain In The Motion Picture Venom Starring Tom Hardy In Sony’s Marvel Movie Universe.</h2><br/><p>Both riot and carnage have proven to be powerful. He was also more dangerous, as instead of attaching itself to a decent guy in eddie brock, it bonded with a sociopath in cletus kasady. The symbiote is a bigger concern.</p><h2>We See That Venom Can Effectively Bite Carnage (Btw, That Shows Venom Is Stronger Than In 2018, Because He Kicks Carnage Farther Than He Kicked Riot, Even Though Venom Was In Worse Stayed Atm Vs Carnage Who Was Upgraded At That Point), Venom Should Have Bit And Scratched Carnage After The Choke Slam.</h2><br/><p>Carnage does not have the extremely quick transformation but it can create multiple weapons rather than just two. Venom even admitted to eddie that they had zero chance of winning in combat. It was initially considered one of the weaker spawns of venom but it’s physically faster and stronger than its siblings.</p></section><section><aside><img alt="VENOM Movie Review tells the story of Marvel’s character" rel="nofollow" title="VENOM Movie Review tells the story of Marvel’s character" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.gaynycdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4139625_VENOM_BD-DVD_Combo_OuterSleeve_FrontLeft.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" /><small><i>Images: bing.com</i></small><br/><p><a href="#" target="_blank"><i>VENOM Movie Review tells the story of Marvel’s character</i></a>, Carnage was the spawn of venom, and that made him stronger than his father.
