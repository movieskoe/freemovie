The thing about venom as a good guy.

One of the most unique aspects of venom is that his powers are sentient.

Big boss is the bad guy because he was super ok with the series' other main bad guy, zero brainwashing and surgically altering a medic to be venom snake, to pretend to be big boss and letting you just do his work for him.

At my venom screening, everyone was eagerly anticipating a laugh riot. Their lungs, just like the guy in the venom 2 theme song.

Gargan became a host to the venom symbiote after eddie brock passed away from cancer and rejected don fortunato’s son angelo. The 2018 venom movie was known for its weirdness and outlandishness.
