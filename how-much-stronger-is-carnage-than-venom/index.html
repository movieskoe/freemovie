In terms of brute strength, yes, carnage is stronger than venom.</p><h2>As A Result, Carnage Is Far More Violent, Powerful, And Deadly Than Venom.</h2><br/><p>Connection to the klyntar hive mind. Venom is more versatile, has regen, and counters champs like imiw when it counts. He&#039;s not physically stronger, but he is more powerful.</p><h2>Venom Is Currently Stronger Cause He Bonded With More Hosts Than Carnage.</h2><br/><p>He&#039;s faster, has more weapons due to having more control over the symbiote itself (tentacles, weapons, etc.) in fact at some points in the comics carnage is shown to be able to completely breakdown cletus&#039;s body to move through small openings/hide rather than needing to separate the symbiote from the host to achieve.
