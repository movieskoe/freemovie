For almost the entirety of carnageâs existence heâs had two weaknesses that all symbiotes share: As the thousandth member of his line, toxin seemed to be especially important to both venom and carnage, implying that perhaps toxin&#039;s status makes him the genetic recipient of.</p><h2>The Bond Between The Carnage Symbiote And Kasady Was Stronger Than The Bond Between Brock And The Venom Symbiote.</h2><br/><p>SymbiÐ¾tes (Ð°lsÐ¾ knÐ¾wn Ð°s klyntÐ°rs) nÐ¾rmÐ°lly Ð¾nly hÐ°ve Ð¾ne offspring, whÐ¾ Ð°re usuÐ°lly mÐ¾re strÐ¾ng thÐ°n.

However there is one factor that may put venom above carnage;</p><h2>The Symbiotes Taken To Earth Were Carnage, Lasher, Phage, Scorn, And Venom.</h2><br/><p>This is because carnage is the spawn of venom and each new evolution is stronger than the last. Venom is from the 998th generation of symbiotes, carnage(and all of venom&#039;s offsprings)are from the 999th generation, carnageâs offsprings are from the 1000th generation, this makes them the strongest of the âfamily. In terms of brute strength, yes, carnage is stronger than venom.</p><h2>As A Result, Carnage Is Far More Violent, Powerful, And Deadly Than Venom.</h2><br/><p>Connection to the klyntar hive mind. Venom is more versatile, has regen, and counters champs like imiw when it counts. He&#039;s not physically stronger, but he is more powerful.</p><h2>Venom Is Currently Stronger Cause He Bonded With More Hosts Than Carnage.</h2><br/><p>He&#039;s faster, has more weapons due to having more control over the symbiote itself (tentacles, weapons, etc.) in fact at some points in the comics carnage is shown to be able to completely breakdown cletus&#039;s body to move through small openings/hide rather than needing to separate the symbiote from the host to achieve.
